## Root cause

The prompts are rendered by AVP:E inside the guest frame, not by the PCSX2
frontend. PCSX2 presents the guest texture before its own optional OSD/UI
composition, and the standalone AVPE shell currently has no prompt overlay or
binding model. The exact AVP:E producer (font glyph, texture atlas, or prompt
sprite) and its draw rectangles have not yet been reverse-engineered.

## What was tried / dead ends

A Qt sibling overlay is not a sufficient replacement: the render surface is a
native child window, stacking is not portable, and additive text would leave
the PS2 glyphs visible. PCSX2's generic prompt font and ImGui OSD are unrelated
to the guest-rendered prompt and cannot replace it. A texture replacement or
masking pass would be unsafe until the guest resource identity and prompt
rectangles are grounded.

## Resolution

Not resolved. The correct implementation seam is a dedicated final-frame GPU
prompt overlay fed by an atomic CPU-produced prompt context, but it remains
blocked on identifying the guest prompt resource/rectangles and on replacing
the hard-coded host key mapping with a shared configurable binding owner.
